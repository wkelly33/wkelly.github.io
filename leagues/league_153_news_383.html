						A jubilant <a href="../players/player_31454.html">Travis Shaw</a> joined the postgame press conference at Globe Life Field today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <a href="../teams/team_58.html">Texas Rangers</a> pitching staff he had just vanquished.<br><br>"It may not have looked like it," said the <a href="../teams/team_59.html">Toronto Blue Jays</a> first baseman, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." <br><br>That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-5 hitting performance, which led the Blue Jays to a 7-6 win.<br><br>"He made it look easy," said <a href="../coaches/coach_2418.html">Chris Woodward</a>, manager of the Rangers. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."<br><br><a href="../players/player_31454.html">Travis Shaw</a> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_29254.html">Juan Nicasio</a> in the 6th, singled in the 8th and hit an RBI single in the 9th.<br><br>Thus far this year <a href="../players/player_31454.html">Shaw</a> has hit .224 with 6 home runs and 15 RBIs. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1219.html">View Boxscore</a>
