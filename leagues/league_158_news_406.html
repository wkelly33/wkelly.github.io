						There aren't many who could be pro ballplayers and there are even fewer who could put up 5 hits in a day.<br><br><a href="../players/player_39835.html">Luis Campusano</a> is one of those rare few, as he went 5-for-6 against the <a href="../teams/team_213.html">Frisco RoughRiders</a> at Dr. Pepper Ballpark today. The monster effort from the 21-year-old catcher helped the <a href="../teams/team_215.html">Amarillo Sod Poodles</a> take the win, 14-5. <br><br>"We made some bad pitches and he took advantage of it," said RoughRiders manager <a href="../coaches/coach_2622.html">Bobby Wilson</a>. "That's the game, though. Don't make mistakes and you'll win ballgames. Make mistakes and, well, you saw what happened today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_39835.html">Luis Campusano</a> singled in the 1st, hit a two-run single in the 1st, doubled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and grounded out in the 9th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_39835.html">Campusano</a> is batting .263 with 1 home run.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_6469.html">View Boxscore</a>
